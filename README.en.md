# ZhuaTech TranslatorAI

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for enterprise AI-assisted workflows with human governance.

ZhuaTech TranslatorAI provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for enterprise AI-assisted workflows with human governance. It is designed for business operators, domain reviewers, AI teams, and administrators, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise translatorai, self-hosted translatorai, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Enterprise Use

- **Primary users:** Business operators, domain reviewers, AI teams, and administrators.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Core Capabilities

- **Operating Unit** — Manage operating unit with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **User** — Coordinate user through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Work Record** — Track work record metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Activity Record** — Preserve activity record evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Review Record** — Expose review record in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Resource Register** — Connect resource register to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Architecture and Runtime

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout

- `backend/` — Java backend, domain services, APIs, validation, and automated tests
- `frontend/` — responsive user and administration interfaces
- `deploy/` — deployment and operations resources
- `docs/` — architecture, operations, screenshots, and supporting documentation
- `compose.yaml` — local multi-service orchestration

## Quick Start

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Review `compose.yaml` before changing published ports, storage paths, or production credentials.

## Verification

Run the checks supported by this repository before changing or deploying it:

```bash
cd backend && mvn test
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
```

## Security and Production Readiness

- Never commit real passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates, customer data, or production connection strings.
- Replace all local demonstration credentials and secrets before deployment.
- Apply least privilege, tenant isolation, backup and restore drills, monitoring, rate limiting, and vulnerability management.
- AI-related features must retain human review, provider configuration, traceability, and safe fallback behavior.
- Please report security issues privately through the contact channels below instead of publishing sensitive details.
